# SkyAirlines

This is my graduation work, which I did in 2024 at the school Vyšší odborná škola, Střední škola, Centrum odborné přípravy, Sezimovo Ústí, Budějovická 421 located in Czech Republic. The "SkyAirlines" app is a flight simulator add-on that allows players to 
create and manage their own virtual airline. Players have the ability to hire real 
pilots who will fly for the airline and earn money for the flight they make. 
reward for both themselves and the airline. The owner of the airline is allowed to 
invest in the purchase of aircraft and new destinations where the airline can fly; and 
improving flight services. A pilot can buy licences for the aircraft he or she will use 
to fly for the airline.
